# A toolbox for the e-commerce manager of BilXtra.no
This project is a collection of APIs and dashboards to help the e-commerce manager for Bilxtra.no. They are using a plattform called Crystallize. 

The toolbox contains pages including, but not contained to:
- a page to help find and filter orders
- a page to search, filter and sort products
- API endpoints to help find roof racks from Thule

There are several more, and this list should expand over time

# Crystallize APIs

- We use a headless e-commerce platform called 'Crystallize'
- The Crystallize platform exposes a range of GraphQL apis to us for us to get data such as orders, customers, product information and so on.
- There are several APIs that are accessed mainly in two ways:
1. The crystallize client [crystallizeClient.ts](mdc:src/lib/crystallizeClient.ts)
2. endpoints like the Discovery API 
- The APIs are somewhat rigid and we must always follow the documentation like [GET_PRODUCTS_WITH_REGEX.md](mdc:GET_PRODUCTS_WITH_REGEX.md) 
- We may not introduce parameters and arguments that are not in the stated examples. If unsure, you must ask




# learnings
As we progress we should maintain a list of learnings here [learnings.md](mdc:learnings.md) - Any time we make new discoveries we should note them here.
